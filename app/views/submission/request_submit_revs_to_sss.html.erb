<h1>Submit Revisions to SSS - Please read carefully</h1>

Clicking the "Submit Revisions" button below, notifies the SSS editorial office
that you've finished making revisions to this submission. The editorial office
will now begin preparing your submission for publication.

<br><br>

Before submitting, it may be helpful to print a final version of the
Submission Proof Report and review it carefully to confirm that the
Submission is indeed ready to be submitted.  Mark that hard-copy "As Submitted"
and keep for your reference.

<br><br>

To avoid any confusion which could be caused by concurrent editing of this
submission during its processing by the editorial office, it will be
locked, thus preventing you from making any further changes.  However, you can
reprint a Proof Report at any time by clicking the Submission Proof Report
link (shown at the lower left).
