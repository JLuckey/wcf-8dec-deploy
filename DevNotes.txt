WCF Converstion to Rails 3 DevNotes

30 Nov 2011
How to setup Rails Dev Environment:

Things you need:
These are Putty sessions to the Linux VM that is running the Rails app

1. Mount the x: drive to appropriate mount point:
    sudo mount -t vboxsf wcf3proj /apps/wcf3

2. Rails web server running in Development mode - [rails s(erver) - from app dir]

3. RSpec session, to run Rspec tests - [bundle exec rspec spec/controllers - from app dir - runs all tests in that folder]
    Or use this command: rspec spec/controllers --drb  (the --drb tells it to use the Spork server and speeds it up, a lot)
    the --drb flag (Distributed Ruby - allows Ruby programs to communicate with each other on the same machine or over a network. DRb uses remote method invocation (RMI) to pass commands and data between processes.)

4. Spork running to speed-up RSpec test runs - [bundle exec spork, from app dir]


Optional
5. mySQL connection

6. General Purpose connection

1. refactor is_member_of to a central location, if possible
2. remove old/obsolete _form.html.erb fiels from view folders
3. 


Steps to connect to MySQL & set-up RSpec for a new project:
14 May 2012

1. rails new AppName -d mysql    ->  new app w/ mySQL db
2. Copy RSpec-specific stuff from other app into Gemfile
3. bundle install
4. Run rails g rspec:install


Considerations When Upgrading
Re-factor for:

thin controllers
fat models
use helpers
create tests


3 May 2012
  1. Re-work Controllers & Views to be compatible w/ new AutoSave capability
  2. Review existing Bug List



2 May 2012
D 1. Add new ajax technique (:onchange in text_field()) to FormBuilder

D 2. Begin analysis of new SIMS schema from DR

D 3. Confirm that HTML widgets used in _field_group_html.erb support the :onchange option



20 Apr 2012
  1. Make sure to test "New" functionality on all objects, due to the special logic as in 
     Instrument Controller "New" method (and most others)

  2. Dump Lookup table to search for inconsitencies

D 3. Review DR email from 17 Apr   

D 4. Ajax AutoSave?

  5. Why do Instrument routes work w/o :id?

D 6. Push to Git 





12 Apr 2012
1. Replace verify method in Controllers - apparently not needed for RESTful routes, but you're
   not using RESTful???


13 Mar 2012
Not worring too much about RESTful routing - just adding routes to routes.rb as needed.


20 Feb 2012
Convert Functionality 
Write Tests
Re-factor 

Conversion from old Prototype AJAX Javascript library to Unobtrusive JavaScript requires
re-writing a AJAX functionality.

Since observe_field (and other javaScript helpers) are not supported in Rails 3 and the
conversion to that functionality is not trivial, I plan to re-write all d/e forms using
'standard' Submit buttons to save the form data.  Then investigate the best way to convert
to AJAX 'auto-save' functionality from previous version.  [13 Mar 2012]


To-do List:
      1. <%#= error_messages_for :user %>  from signup.html.erb  - doesn't work in Rails 3?
      2. review params hash from account_controller - user info is in nested hash?
      3. Convert Forgot Your Passsword? funtionality
Done  4. Get Login to work
Done  5. Get Submission Nav Bar working [13Mar2012]
Done  6. Get Submission Editing working
      7. Test all methods in Account_Controller
      8. Convert all items in SubmissNavBar


Get login to work - Notes: 
1. Do analysis route-by-route
2. Re-factor login controller & views
3. Write some tests

Get Submission Nav Bar to work - Notes:
  1. Re-factor controllers & views
  
  2. Write some tests

D 3. Convert Form Builder to Rails 3

D 4. Convert ActiveScaffold to new Rails 3 version

  5. Refactor SubmissionController - fat model/thin controller/use helpers

  6. Make Logout action clear Session

Files to Move for Conversion to Rails 3.1

User, Login, etc.
1. Models
    - user.rb
    - user_notifier.rb
    - user_observer.rb
    - invitee_user.rb
    - submiss_user.rb

2. Controllers
    - user_controller.rb
    - account_controller.rb

3. Views - folders
    - account
    - user
    - user_notifer


4 Jan 2010
Steps to convert from old to Rails 3.1

1. Move Controller
2. Move Model
3. Move View folder, rename .rhtml files to .html.erb
4. Check new files into git
5. Update routes.rb - consider RESTful routes
6. In template files change <% %> to <%= %> where appropriate
7. Get new versions of plug-ins
8. Devise tests



31 Jan 2012
  1. Use controller.sign_in(user) in spec_helper.rb in test_sign_in(user) method
  2. rspec have_selector erroneously returns true even when :content evals to null



26 Jan 2012
To-do
  1. debug:  it "should return the user on password/email match" do  test in user_spec.rb.  User.authenticate method is
     working but test fails - don't have time to debug right now.
 
  u = User.create({ :login => 'gbush', :email => 'gb@wh.gov', :password => 'foobar', :password_confirmation => 'foobar' })


23 Jan 2012
TDD Dev Sequence

1. Consider new feature/page
2. Devise & code 1 or 2 tests - they should fail
3. Code to make tests green
4. Repeat




1 Nov 2011

Tuesday to-dos in prep for setting-up new Rails environment


D   1. What is latest version of Rails & do all WCF-necessary plugins work with it?

D   2. What is the Asset Pipeline & why do I want one?

    3. 


gem install activerecord-mysql2-adapter

therubyracer

  2. add lines to Gemfile
  3. bundle install
  4. add a Javascript runtime - therubyracer - by adding: gem 'execjs' gem 'therubyracer' to Gemfile
  5. rails generate rspec:install
  6. test step 5 w/ bundle exec rspec spec/
  7. configure database in config/database.yml

How to subdivide the work logically?

by Controller
by Model
by feature
by screen/page -> Submission Nav Bar item


Recon plugins, modules, add-ins & find 3.1 versions/equivalents
1. ActiveScaffold
2. 

Reasonable Place to Start? by screen/page

1. Home/login page
2. My submissions
3. Forgot password
4. Registration Page



Linux/VirtualBox Shared Folder Command

sudo mount -t vboxsf wcf3proj           /apps/wcf3
                      folder share name   mount point


Things I want to know about
12 Aug 2011

1. Gems & Bundler
2. Routes in 3.1
3. Testing & Rspec
4.
